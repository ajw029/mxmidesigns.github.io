    <h3>Biology and appearance</h3>
    <p>Porgs were a species of non-sentient birds. They were stocky in nature, with two short wings, flat, beak-less faces, and two webbed feet. Porgs were sexually dimorphic; males were slightly larger than females, and males also had orange plumage around the eyes. Porgs of both sexes were covered in dense feathers, with white coloration on the body and face, and gray to brown on the wings and back. They were much lighter than they looked, thanks to a thick outer layer of waterproof feathers with a fluffy underlayer for warmth. They could fly short distances but not far enough to leave their native island. They could also run quite swiftly on the ground and were good at maneuvering into small spaces.[5] The birds had stereoscopic vision, colored with brown irises and black pupils.[4] Porgs favored colder environments.[5]</p>

    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    <h3>These hyper-curious, cliff-dwelling creatures were found throughout the islands of the planet Ahch-To. They were capable of performing controlled dives into the sea, where they fetched fish to feed on or pass on to their otherwise helpless offspring, which were called "porglets".[4] They also hunted crustaceans.</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Porgs exhibited a roosting behavior, and they built nests along the island cliffs.</li>
      <li>UThey built nests from hair, fiber or grass and decorate them with shiny objects they had acquired</li>
      <li>Porgs loved water, both to drink and to play in./li>
    </ol>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>At the time of the First Orderâ€“Resistance war, when Jedi Master Luke Skywalker threw his lightsaber off a cliff, two porgs investigated the weapon. The birds nearly activated the weapon, before they were scared off by Rey. Shortly afterwards, another porg watched in curiosity from its nest as the Jedi Master spearfished from an island cliff.</p>
